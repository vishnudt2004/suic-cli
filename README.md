# Simple UI Components

**Simple UI Components** is a **personal, local-first collection of reusable UI and frontend utility components** — installed locally as editable source code with minimal setup. Each component is **handcrafted from scratch**, reflecting my own ideas and needs while staying flexible enough to adapt to yours.

This is **not** a large, general-purpose UI library. Instead, it’s a **curated set of distinctive, editable components** designed for **direct integration into your projects** — perfect for portfolio work, prototypes, or internal tools.

> **Note:**  
> Every component is built independently — no direct copies from other libraries.

## Simple UI Components – CLI

The **suic-cli** (Simple UI Components CLI) is the official command-line tool for the SUIC ecosystem.  
It makes it easy to install, manage, and explore reusable components from **suic-core** in just a few commands and it also provides quick access to documentation and usage examples.
